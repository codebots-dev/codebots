.. note::

    This pacakge is a WIP! Expect things to be very different among versions. However,
    the stable releases will always work and pass all the tests.

    If you want to access the latest functionalities, clone the GitHub repo and switch
    to the `develop` branch, although it is very likely that things won't work! :)
