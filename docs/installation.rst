Installation

Stable release
--------------

To install bots, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install bots

This is the preferred method to install bots, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

------------

The sources for bots can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

    $ git clone git://github.com/franaudo/bots

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -OJL https://github.com/franaudo/bots/tarball/master
