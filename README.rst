This is a collection of simple bots to help with boring tasks during coding.

Currently supported bots:

* :code:`EmailBot`: useful to get an email when a task is complete
* :code:`SlackBot`: same thing, but you get a slack message instead.
* :code:`TeleBot`: again the same thing, but you get a message on Telegram this time.
* :code:`sshBot`: this is different...it will help you with ssh stuff.
* :code:`DeployBot`: this bot is in charge of helping you with repository deployments.
* :code:`DriveBot`: in case you need to automate the way you talk to your G-Drive.
* :code:`LatexBot`: if you are a nerd and you use latex but the ones around you are not.
